                      <p>Hey my name is Payal.Some of my friends call me PayPal. Basically my name autocorrects to Paypal on the iphone.</p><img class= hello_world src="IMG_7068.jpg" width="200" height="250"> <p> I am currently studying webdeveloping and loving it. </p><p>I like to read and watch documentaries in my free time. I am also a really good cook.</p>
                        I am terrible at talking about myself to be quite honest. I am hoping this coding bootcamp isn't going to be a killer experience.</p>
                        <p>I use to do a lot of HTML sites in my youth (geocities days if anyone remembers that).  However somehow I ended up becoming a pharmacist (which wasn't bad).</p><p>I am hoping to become a junior full stacks developer after this course and finally find a job I am passionate about.</p>
                        <p>I really appreciate my families support during this transition. It isn't easy to transition to another field. Hopefully it will end well and I will use my passion of creating websites in my day to day life.</p>
